"""Generator for arc_additional_puzzle_bank_volume5:H32 — Cells reached by ≥2 1-seed rays.

Rule: for each 1-seed, cast 4 cardinal rays through non-8 cells; count
how many rays reach each cell. Cells with count==2 → 2.

Combinatorial axes (8): grid_h, grid_w, palette_kind, n_seeds,
palette_size, position_bias, n_distinct_colors, density, texture.
Degenerates: no_seeds, single_seed, no_overlap.
